    "notes": "Dear diary. We tried to walk Icarus and Ezio outside on a leash. Very sadly, when it was Ezio's turn, he escaped his leash and jumped a fence. Hannah tried to hold him from escaping, but he jumped into the next door neighbour's garden. We briefly saw him 5 minutes later in the garden, but he ran when I rattled some treats next to the fence. Since then, we've walked around the neighbourhood, climbed a few fences, and explored the back recesses of the space behind gardens in our area. Unfortunuately, we have not found Ezio yet. We sat outside with the litter tray, a food bowl, and Ezio's favourite blanket. After the sun set, because it was very cold (12oC), we set up our motion detection cameras with the bowl and are hoping Ezio comes home safely for foods, and nuzzles, and cuddles, and head scritches... *malp* 18:50, motion on back camera, partial head. Went out and tapped food bowl like at feeding time, but whatever cat it was, ran to the end of the garden, waited for a bit, and eventually fled over the compost heap. 19:00, Hannah spotted a cat under a car two corners away. The cat was rolling around, it saw me as I approached and rolled off back towards the gardens. We got more motion on the security cameras at 7:44, Ezio can be clearly seen sniffing the food sponge and food bowl that we left outside. However, when we came out to check on him I think we scared him away. We could clearly hear him meowing, and so followed him to the fence, and into the neighbour's garden, only for him to back away from us. Knowing that he wasn't far away, I sat outside wrapped in a blanket from 7:57 until 8:16, I was getting cold, so moved to go back inside when I saw Ezio coming over the fence. I stepped inside the kitchen and beckoned him inside, briefly moving out to pick up the food bowl and place it inside the kitchen. Once Ezio was back inside, we gave him some time to eat his food, and then gave him an extra 5g of dry cat food. We settled down to hug and nuzzle the cats, Ezio seemed a bit more distant then normal, but was happy to climb on our laps and be petted."
