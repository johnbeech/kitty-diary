    "notes": "Dear diary. We tried to walk Icarus and Ezio outside on a leash. Very sadly, when it was Ezio's turn, he escaped his leash and jumped a fence. Hannah tried to hold him from escaping, but he jumped into the next door neighbour's garden. We briefly saw him 5 minutes later in the garden, but he ran when I rattled some treats next to the fence. Since then, we've walked around the neighbourhood, climbed a few fences, and explored the back recesses of the space behind gardens in our area.\n\nUnfortunuately, we have not found Ezio yet. We sat outside with the litter tray, a food bowl, and Ezio's favourite blanket. After the sun set, because it was very cold (12oC), we set up our motion detection cameras with the bowl and are hoping Ezio comes home safely for foods, and nuzzles, and cuddles, and head scritches... *malp* 18:50, motion on back camera, partial head. Went out and tapped food bowl like at feeding time, but whatever cat it was, ran to the end of the garden, waited for a bit, and eventually fled over the compost heap. \n\n19:00, Hannah spotted a cat under a car two corners away. The cat was rolling around, it saw me as I approached and rolled off back towards the gardens. We got more motion on the security cameras at 7:44, Ezio can be clearly seen sniffing the food sponge and food bowl that we left outside. However, when we came out to check on him I think we scared him away. We could clearly hear him meowing, and so followed him to the fence, and into the neighbour's garden, only for him to back away from us.\n\nKnowing that he wasn't far away, I sat outside wrapped in a blanket from 7:57 until 8:16, I was getting cold, so moved to go back inside when I saw Ezio coming over the fence. I stepped inside the kitchen and beckoned him inside, briefly moving out to pick up the food bowl and place it inside the kitchen. Once Ezio was back inside, we gave him some time to eat his food, and then gave him an extra 5g of dry cat food. We settled down to hug and nuzzle the cats, Ezio seemed a bit more distant then normal, but was happy to climb on our laps and be petted."

We resealed the fish and stored it away in a cupboard. Later they pulled down the plastic box the fish was previous stored in. Concerned about them getting up onto the pantry shelves and finding other food. Otherwise both cats seem happy this morning and ate their food ok."

I picked Icarus up before feeding, he was somewhat timid towards me, but didn't seem to mind when I scooped him up and gave him a cuddle. Ezio meowed at me when I went to the far side of the table instead of opening the cupboard to feed them.\n\nHowever, in the evening, when I got home - I found the plastic remains of a jam and chocolate cake desert. One or both of the cats had eaten it. Ezio seemed much chunkier, and Icarus appeared his normal self. When it approached feeding time, I toyed with them a bit - only Icarus meowed. As I put the food down, Ezio paid no attention to it what so ever. Looks like we'd found the perpretrator. Ezio was probably on a sugar high at this point; its quite possible he's eaten his normal meal amount + another 100g in cake. After not eating his food, we allowed Icarus to continue eating Ezio's bowl, which he managed to complete 80-90% of before giving up. After cuddling a sleepy Ezio, he then pawed towards the kitchen door, and then decided to throw up repeatedly across the floor and carpet. What a troublesome cat we have (we still love you). After that, and lots of cleaning, Ezio regained some sense of normality. I got him drinking out of the water bowl, and he licked up a bit of the food left over from earlier. I imagine he's still on a sugar high and kind of hungry, but at least he appears ok. He's been meowing after us and following us around the house, with varying levels of attention and hugs. He even dozed off for a bit on our laps or beside us.\n\nHannah got the litter tray cleaned out and vacuumed up the kitchen. Not too messy, but clunky. We're in a pattern of changing the litter twice a week, Tuesday evenings and Saturday mornings.\n\nJust deciding whether to feed Ezio again before bed, to make sure his energy levels are ok. In the end, I brought him downstairs and closed Icarus away, feeding 15g of Dry Tuna to Ezio to at least give him something to get him through to the morning."

We had them upstairs for a bit, but Ezio meowed lots when we closed some of the upstairs doors. Same when we were downstairs trying to keep them off the table. We also had to keep them out the kitchen while I was mowing the lawn, emptying the bins, and changing the litter. Switched back to the slightly more expensive wood litter, after we decided that the cheaper disintergrated too quickly. Ended up vacuuming the kitchen several times during the day.\n\nDuring the afternoon Hannah fed them a portion of the cat milk each, they lapped it up in no time, definitely tasty for them. There was also a mystery involving egg-pan-water which dissapeared off the cooker. There wasn't too much water, but we don't normally see them licking or drinking plain water, so that was slightly concerning.\n\nEvening food went down ok, Ezio didn't quite finish all of his food, and I had to move the bowl away from Icarus a few times, but they got there in the end."
